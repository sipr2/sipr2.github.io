            <p>Our first project, <a href="">Half-Life</a>, shows off Valve's proprietary technology, including 16-bit
                color, colored
                lighting and amazing advances in character movement – all without the benefit of hardware accelerators.
                Half-Life also incorporates technology licensed from <a href="">id Software.</a></p>

            <p><a href="">Sierra On-Line</a> is the exclusive publisher and distributor of Half-Life, which will be
                available mid-March, 1998.</p>

            <p>
                Half-Life introduces a revolutionary leap in the 3D first-person gaming genre by combining stunning
                technology enhancements with genre-breaking gameplay elements. Gamers are given opportunities to wreak
                havoc--in true action-game fashion--but they are also challenged to explore and strategize; for
                instance, telling friend from foe is no longer a simple matter of humans vs. monsters. Half-life's
                strong story elements, advanced inventory system and story-integrated challenges create an experience
                never-before-seen in traditional "run-and-gun" action games.</p>
